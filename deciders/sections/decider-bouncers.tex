\section{Bouncers}\label{sec:bouncers}

Intuitively, a \emph{bouncer} is a Turing machine that builds a tape with
ever-expanding repeating fragments. We shall refine this definition later,
such that it clearly explains what machines the decider should hope to decide.

\paragraph{Notation.} For a tape segment $s \in \{0, 1\}^*$, we will
write $(s)$ to mean $s$ repeated any number of times, i.e.~$s^k$ for
an unspecified $k$. 

\begin{example}
    $0\,(110)\,1$ can refer to $01$, $01101$, $01101101$, and so on.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A bouncer's \emph{reset configuration} is given by
    a list of \emph{walls} $w_0,\ \ldots,\ w_n \in \{0, 1\}^*$
    and \emph{repeaters} $r_1,\ \ldots,\ r_n$, as well as a fixed state $q$,
    and refers to the configuration
    \begin{equation}
        0^\infty\; [0]\; w_0\; (r_1)\; w_1\; (r_2)\; w_2\: \cdots\: (r_n)\; w_n,
    \end{equation}
    in state $q$.
\end{definition}

% TODO: We would probably want an illustration here. Perhaps a space-time
% diagram with the reset configurations marked?
